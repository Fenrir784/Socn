To start using Socn you have to get an application token for [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/) or [VK](https://vk.com/dev).

After getting the token, write it to file .Socn/tw.secret or .Socn/vk.secret (for Linux and OS X folder .Socn is in ~, for Windows folder .Socn is in %appdata%) depending on which applicaton token you have got.

Then you can simply click the connect button on the top of the main window and follow instructions on the screen.
